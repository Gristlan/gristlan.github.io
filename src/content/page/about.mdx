---

I'm gay Canadian game developer with cerebral palsy. My partner and I have been together since I was 18—his love and belief in me changed my life. He encouraged me to pursue education, supported me through job searches, and stood by me through every major milestone.

In 2020, like many others, we faced a turning point. I lost my job during the pandemic, and we began dreaming of a quieter, simpler life. We sold everything to continue living while the pressures kept growing. I turned to what had always brought me joy and comfort: storytelling and video games.

Now, I create games rooted in empathy, accessibility, and gentle connection. Games that reflect life’s quiet struggles and small triumphs. My goal is to build experiences that welcome everyone, especially those who often feel left out—people with disabilities, people who are different, people who are healing.

I hope my games help others feel less alone, and maybe even a little more hopeful.
